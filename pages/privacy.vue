            <h4>Dear Clients…</h4>
            <p>
              Your satisfaction with our products and services is our TOP
              priority and we would go an extra mile to assure that. We are a
              dynamic company and do realize that without our loyal clients and
              referrals we wouldn’t exist, so we are always open for suggestions
              and would do our best to accommodate your requests. Our store
              Payment and Privacy policies are as follows:
            </p>
            <h3>PAYMENTS</h3>
            <p>
              Our webstore uses a Comodo SSL certificate to secure online
              transactions for customers and the status can be verified by
              clicking on the seal at the bottom of every page. We use PayPal
              for payments processing as the most reliable payment processing
              company in the world. We constantly monitor the threats and assure
              the security of all of the information being entered at our
              website.
            </p>

            <h3>TAXES</h3>
            <p>
              For Canadian orders, we are charging the regular sales taxes
              appropriate by law to the Province or Territory we are shipping
              to. For any orders with shipping address located outside of
              Canada, we are not charging any sales taxes on top of the posted
              prices.
            </p>
