              ProSkaters Place is taking your privacy very seriously. This site
              was built with your safety and information security in mind,
              offering a worry-free shopping experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              ProSkaters Place requires only the personal information, which is
              absolutely necessary to communicate with you and to provide you
              with a smooth shopping experience. This information would be used
              for shipping the ordered products as well. None of the financial
              information about our clients is stored on our servers, and we
              keep no credit card information besides the last four digits. We
              do not grant access, give, or rent out any personal information to
              any third-party organizations.
