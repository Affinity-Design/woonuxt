Despite its big size the reduced amount of urethane results in one of the lightest wheels on the market with only 68gr it’s 25% lighter than other wheels of the same size. The wheels come with treated lines on the rolling patch to give extra grip on slippery surfaces.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I was looking for a faster wheel to skate bowls, but I ended with the perfect all-round wheel.

Not only the performance is good, but I was hoping for a fairly priced wheel with a clean and timeless design to match any style.

The upper portions of the knee and elbow pads are made of eco-friendly, abrasion-resistant recycled polyethylene (rPET), while the cotton sock sleeves and elastic Velcro straps keep the pads firmly in place. To complete the comprehensive safety features, the knee and elbow pads feature large, flat caps made of polyethylene (PE), including 15% recycled material.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you’re inline skating or enjoying other action sports, the POWERSLIDE Standard Eco set with lightweight wristguards features wide palm splints and durable back splints for maximum wrist protection.

The smaller wheels in the front give optimal maneuverability, while the bigger back wheels provide a faster ride. Attention: This is not a rockered frame!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Adapt Symetrics Freestyle Quattro Frames are mounted using the Quattro Mount, designed and developed by Adapt.

This way of mounting greatly improves power transfer and the overall strength of the frame.

The Adapt GTO Hyperskate model has been a pillar in the Adapt lineup since its original release in 2016. The model has evolved over time but has stayed true to its original values: fast, responsive, and beautiful, a true representative of the &#8216;GTO&#8217; badge.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For 2023, Adapt focused on refining their model while meticulously redesigning the toebox, ensuring it gives more space in height and width, without making the skate look bulky in the toe area. Furthermore, they have upgraded the foam in the lining piece to give a more comfortable fit. The lace bite prevention strip on the tongue of Adapt GTO Hyperskate Black Edition Skates now has a lace loop to ensure the tongue stays nicely in place while skating.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since 2022, all Adapt models come with a replaceable heel/ankle lining piece. The lining piece ensures a better fit for the ankle, prevents pressure points from the cuff area, and can be replaced when worn down, expanding the lifetime of the skates even further!  On the Adapt GTO Hyperskate Black Edition Skates, the lining piece is fully heat-moldable at lower temperatures and even forms when simply skating. It can also be removed before heat molding the shell to prevent foam compression during more rigorous heat molding.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although Adapt made changes to the lining system of the skate, they worked very hard to ensure that Adapt would always feel direct, responsive, and comfortable. With the new system, getting the perfect fit that every Adapt customer deserves has gotten easier.

The Ranger collection is designed for freeride skiers who live for soft snow: powder, crud, corn; we like it all. Sure we rail groomers, but given the choice, we’re in the soft stuff. The collection is split into two groups: Ti and FR. The Ti skis have two sheets of Titanal and are ideal for technical skiers who want smooth, damp, and precision, and who control speed through turn shape. The FR group has slightly more taper and rocker and is built for creative, progressive skiers that slip seamlessly from carving to drifting to control speed, and see terrain features as a playful opportunity to slash or butter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you find yourself skiing more hard snow than soft, but still want a capable tool for those deeper days, the Ranger 92 Ti is your ski. A deeper sidecut and two sheets of metal provide precision, edgehold, and stability for those hard, fast days. When you do get off-piste, the slight rocker and taper, combined with the carbon shovel, give it the ease and nimbleness required for softer snow in tight trees or chutes.</p>\n","productCategories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Alpine Skis","slug":"alpine-skis"},{"name":"Clearance!","slug":"clearance-items"},{"name":"Discount Products","slug":"discount-products"},{"name":"Winter Sports","slug":"winter-sports"}]},"price":"454.99","regularPrice":"909.99","salePrice":"454.99","stockStatus":"IN_STOCK","onSale":true,"manageStock":null,"stockQuantity":null,"image":{"sourceUrl":"https://proskatersplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fischer-ranger-92-ti-skis-2022--300x300.jpeg","altText":"Fischer Ranger 92 TI Freeride Alpine Skis","title":"Fischer Ranger 92 TI Freeride Alpine Skis"}},{"databaseId":133089,"name":"Fischer RC One 78 GT Alpine Skis","slug":"fischer-rc-one-78-gt-alpine-skis","sku":"FIA09521V1","shortDescription":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fischer RC One 78 GT Alpine Skis.

Start your child off right with a great foundation for skiing, RC4 10 offers a flex of 10 so small skiers can flex the boots and learn how it feels to ski. Comfortable Thermoshape allows the Fischer RC4 10 Junior Thermoshape Ski Boots liner to take the shape of the foot used in the boot, this results in great comfort and performance.

This design also creates less stress on the knee and ankle joints.</div>\n<div id=\"long-description\" class=\"description-style\">\n<p><b>Fischer Fit System: </b>Knowing that no two skiers are the same, Fischer mixes the feature list to match the performance and comfort level that different levels of skiers need.
