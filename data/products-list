When you look at the wheels market, most of the options came from skateboard companies or from roller skate brands selling wheels with shapes made for skateboarding. While these wheels are good for some uses and work great in sidestance skating, They always felt they are too wide to carve bowls on a parallel stance with the edges of the wheels catching against the ramps.

Despite its big size the reduced amount of urethane results in one of the lightest wheels on the market with only 68gr itâs 25% lighter than other wheels of the same size. The wheels come with treated lines on the rolling patch to give extra grip on slippery surfaces.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">âI was looking for a faster wheel to skate bowls, but I ended with the perfect all-round wheel.

We, like countless other people, are shocked by the senseless war happening right now in Ukraine and we need to do something to help the people suffering from the Russian invasion.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a roller skate company, the best way for us to make a statement and support the people affected by this needless war is to release a skate. With CHAYA Melrose Deluxe NO WAR Roller Skates, CHAYA will donate 100% of sales to non-profit charity organizations directly involved with helping the people of Ukraine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chaya will split the funds between these two charity organizations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ukrainian Medical Association in Germany e.V. https://www.uaevd.de/ Intended use: Medical aid for soldiers and civilian</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">National Bank of Ukraine: Humanity Fonds https://bank.gov.ua/en/news/all/natsionalniy-bank-vidkriv-rahunok-dlya-gumanitarnoyi-dopomogi-ukrayintsyam-postrajdalim-vid-rosiyskoyi-agresiyi Intended use: Food, shelter, clothing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you know any other charity organization helping the victims of the war in Ukraine or are you involved in a non-profit project, please send us a message and we might be able to help.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chaya has released 500 pairs of special Melrose Deluxe NO WAR skates!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our sincere appreciation goes out to the suppliers who have shown solidarity by providing the parts for the CHAYA Deluxe NO WAR skate at the lowest costs possible, illustrating that together we can make a difference and support the people who need it most.

These frames have a hi-lo wheel configuration. This means the two front wheels are smaller than the two back wheels (except for the Quattro R model). The smaller wheels in the front give optimal maneuverability, while the bigger back wheels provide a faster ride. Attention: This is not a rockered frame!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Adapt Symetrics Freestyle Quattro Frames are mounted using the Quattro Mount, designed and developed by Adapt. Unlike regular frames, the Quattro S frame is mounted on the outside of the frame, using 4 M6 stainless steel bolts, which are &#8211; like the frame &#8211; designed and manufactured in-house. This way of mounting greatly improves power transfer and the overall strength of the frame. The frame does not flex under the boot as frames mounted with 2 or 3 bolts do.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Quattro frames are CNC machined out of a solid block of 7000 aluminum and have intact sidewalls and internal bridges for maximum strength. Compared to the 2021 and earlier Quattro frames, Adapt has slimmed down the design a bit to decrease the weight.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Adapt Symetrics Freestyle Quattro Frames are fully made in the Netherlands and designed by Pieter Wijnant, this frame is the next level when it comes to skating. Every frame is CNC machined to perfection and anodized for a perfect finish. The graphics are laser burned into the frame.

The Adapt GTO Hyperskate model has been a pillar in the Adapt lineup since its original release in 2016. The model has evolved over time but has stayed true to its original values: fast, responsive, and beautiful, a true representative of the &#8216;GTO&#8217; badge.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For 2023, Adapt focused on refining their model while meticulously redesigning the toebox, ensuring it gives more space in height and width, without making the skate look bulky in the toe area. Furthermore, they have upgraded the foam in the lining piece to give a more comfortable fit. The lace bite prevention strip on the tongue of Adapt GTO Hyperskate Black Edition Skates now has a lace loop to ensure the tongue stays nicely in place while skating.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since 2022, all Adapt models come with a replaceable heel/ankle lining piece. The lining piece ensures a better fit for the ankle, prevents pressure points from the cuff area, and can be replaced when worn down, expanding the lifetime of the skates even further!Â  On the Adapt GTO Hyperskate Black Edition Skates, the lining piece is fully heat-moldable at lower temperatures and even forms when simply skating. It can also be removed before heat molding the shell to prevent foam compression during more rigorous heat molding.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although Adapt made changes to the lining system of the skate, they worked very hard to ensure that Adapt would always feel direct, responsive, and comfortable. With the new system, getting the perfect fit that every Adapt customer deserves has gotten easier. Showcasing Adapt&#8217;s new logo in a classic way, the GTO comes with an embossed logo on the tongue and the infamous red embroidered GTO logo on the back of the skate.</p>\n","productCategories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Inline Skate Shop","slug":"inline-skates"},{"name":"Inline Skating","slug":"inline-skating"}]},"price":"1252.99","regularPrice":"1252.99","salePrice":null,"stockStatus":"OUT_OF_STOCK","onSale":false,"manageStock":null,"stockQuantity":null,"image":{"sourceUrl":"https://proskatersplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Adapt-GTO-2023-Black-300x300.jpg","altText":"Adapt GTO Hyperskate Black Edition Skates","title":"Adapt GTO Hyperskate Black Edition Skates"}},{"databaseId":147146,"name":"Fischer Cross Country Narrow Mohair Twin Skin","slug":"fischer-cross-country-narrow-mohair-twin-skin","sku":"FIK51219","shortDescription":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fischer Cross Country Narrow Mohair Twin Skin.

Two specialized products really get the job done: Easy Skin Cleaner cleans out everything that accumulates in the skin to ensure top gliding and climbing capabilities. The complementary Easy Anti Ice Skin HF, a liquid fluorine wax, reduces ice build-up on the skin when conditions vary between moist and dry snow.

FR Skates offers a brand new UFR street skate. UFR Street AP FLAT are complete skates coming with FLAT frames designed by Antony Pottier himself. He used regular freeskating frames in street skating for several years, because of their agility and speed, but they were obviously limiting when it came to rick vocabulary. Thus, he created the concept of frames that will merge the best aspects of aggressive and freeskating frames.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">FLAT is super solid, rigid, and responsive thanks to being made out of aluminum, with the level of quality you can find in the best freeskating frames. At the same time, they come with generous, replaceable H-block, giving you the comfort of locking onto groove tricks without worrying about wheelbite. Seeing that the maximum wheel size is 65 mm, the frames are still pretty low profile, but give you decent roll and speed.</p>\n","productCategories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Clearance!","slug":"clearance-items"},{"name":"Discount Products","slug":"discount-products"},{"name":"Inline Skate Shop","slug":"inline-skates"},{"name":"Inline Skating","slug":"inline-skating"}]},"price":"328.99","regularPrice":"503.99","salePrice":"328.99","stockStatus":"IN_STOCK","onSale":true,"manageStock":null,"stockQuantity":null,"image":{"sourceUrl":"https://proskatersplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FR-UFR-AP-Skates-300x300.jpg","altText":"FR UFR Street AP Flat 65 Aggressive Inline Skates","title":"FR UFR Street AP Flat 65 Aggressive Inline Skates"}},{"databaseId":139819,"name":"Powerslide Nordic CST 150mm SUV Air Jacket","slug":"powerslide-nordic-cst-150mm-suv-air-jacket","sku":"908318","shortDescription":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Powerslide Nordic CST 150mm SUV Air Jacket is the replacement outer jacket fitting 6&#8243; / 150mm tires used for SUV off-road skating.

The liner piece ensures a better fit for the ankle, prevents pressure points from the cuff area, and can be replaced when worn down, expanding the lifetime of the skates even further!</li>\n<li>The liner piece can also be removed before heatmolding the shell, to prevent foam compression when pushing out pressure points.</li>\n<li>The tongue has been redesigned with a pressure-dividing patch to prevent lacebite.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The GTB now comes with an included (removable) 45 degrees powerstrap for increased heel lock. Especially for skaters with flat feet or a low arch, the powerstrap can improve the fit significantly.</p>\n<p>Showcasing our new logo in an eye-catching way, the GTB comes with an embroidered orange Adapt logo on the tongue and an orange embroidered GTB logo on the back of the skate.</p>\n","productCategories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Clearance!","slug":"clearance-items"},{"name":"Discount Products","slug":"discount-products"},{"name":"Inline Skate Shop","slug":"inline-skates"},{"name":"Inline Skating","slug":"inline-skating"}]},"price":"727.99","regularPrice":"965.99","salePrice":"727.99","stockStatus":"IN_STOCK","onSale":true,"manageStock":null,"stockQuantity":null,"image":{"sourceUrl":"https://proskatersplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/adapt-gtb-2022_4-300x300.jpeg","altText":"ADAPT Bill Stoppard GTB 2022 Boots","title":"ADAPT Bill Stoppard GTB 2022 Boots"}},{"databaseId":139572,"name":"Rollerblade Hydrogen 84mm 85A Wheels (2 pack)","slug":"rollerblade-hydrogen-84mm-85a-wheels","sku":"06635700100","shortDescription":"<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Rollerblade Hydrogen 84mm 85A Wheels deliver unmatched performance, power, and response.

Having smaller tolerances means that your bearing will spin faster, for longer.</p>\n","productCategories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Inline Skate Bearings","slug":"inline-skate-bearings"},{"name":"Roller Skate Bearings","slug":"roller-skate-bearings"}]},"price":"37.99","regularPrice":"37.99","salePrice":null,"stockStatus":"IN_STOCK","onSale":false,"manageStock":"TRUE","stockQuantity":4,"image":{"sourceUrl":"https://proskatersplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Wicked-Abec-7-300x280.jpg","altText":"WICKED ABEC 7 Freespin Bearings","title":"WICKED ABEC 7 Freespin Bearings"}},{"databaseId":135476,"name":"Flying Eagle Nova White LED 64mm 85A Wheels (4 Pack)","slug":"flying-eagle-nova-white-led-64mm-85a-wheels","sku":"FE-W-NOVA-64","shortDescription":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Flying Eagle Nova White LED 64mm 85A Wheels are another LED wheel from the Flying Eagle brand with a clean design, quality LEDs, and reliable performance.

The Ranger collection is designed for freeride skiers who live for soft snow: powder, crud, corn; we like it all. Sure we rail groomers, but given the choice, weâre in the soft stuff. The collection is split into two groups: Ti and FR. The Ti skis have two sheets of Titanal and are ideal for technical skiers who want smooth, damp, and precision, and who control speed through turn shape. The FR group has slightly more taper and rocker and is built for creative, progressive skiers that slip seamlessly from carving to drifting to control speed, and see terrain features as a playful opportunity to slash or butter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you find yourself skiing more hard snow than soft, but still want a capable tool for those deeper days, the Ranger 92 Ti is your ski. A deeper sidecut and two sheets of metal provide precision, edgehold, and stability for those hard, fast days. When you do get off-piste, the slight rocker and taper, combined with the carbon shovel, give it the ease and nimbleness required for softer snow in tight trees or chutes.</p>\n","productCategories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Alpine Skis","slug":"alpine-skis"},{"name":"Clearance!","slug":"clearance-items"},{"name":"Discount Products","slug":"discount-products"},{"name":"Winter Sports","slug":"winter-sports"}]},"price":"454.99","regularPrice":"909.99","salePrice":"454.99","stockStatus":"IN_STOCK","onSale":true,"manageStock":null,"stockQuantity":null,"image":{"sourceUrl":"https://proskatersplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fischer-ranger-92-ti-skis-2022--300x300.jpeg","altText":"Fischer Ranger 92 TI Freeride Alpine Skis","title":"Fischer Ranger 92 TI Freeride Alpine Skis"}},{"databaseId":133089,"name":"Fischer RC One 78 GT Alpine Skis","slug":"fischer-rc-one-78-gt-alpine-skis","sku":"FIA09521V1","shortDescription":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fischer RC One 78 GT Alpine Skis.

Start your child off right with a great foundation for skiing, RC4 10 offers a flex of 10 so small skiers can flex the boots and learn how it feels to ski. Comfortable Thermoshape allows the Fischer RC4 10 Junior Thermoshape Ski Boots liner to take the shape of the foot used in the boot, this results in great comfort and performance. Outfit your smallest skier with the best from Fischer.</p>\n<div id=\"icons\" class=\"description-style\"><b>SOMA-Tec: </b>The positioning of the feet in a SOMA boot is in a natural &#8216;V&#8217; shape, with the toes pointed slightly outward, and the heels slightly inward. This positioning puts the skier&#8217;s center of gravity over the middle of the ski for better control and edging power. This design also creates less stress on the knee and ankle joints.</div>\n<div id=\"long-description\" class=\"description-style\">\n<p><b>Fischer Fit System: </b>Knowing that no two skiers are the same, Fischer mixes the feature list to match the performance and comfort level that different levels of skiers need. This ensures that recreational skiers don&#8217;t end up with boots that have a race fit, and ensures that racers don&#8217;t end up with a squishy comfort liner.</p>\n<p><b>Full Thermo Fit Liner: </b>Body heat activates the material in this liner to shape to the skier&#8217;s foot faster than a standard liner. The insulation also has heat reflective properties to keep the warm in, and the cold out.</p>\n<p><b>Tongue Pull:</b>A loop of fabric at the top of the tongue helps in putting on and removing the boots. Pull it forward and to the side and your foot should slide right in.</p>\n<p><b>Replaceable Toe and Heel Pads: </b>This is a must-have for skiers that don&#8217;t live in ski-in/ski-out condos.
