# How to Skate Backwards on Roller Skates & Inline Skates: 5-Minute Tutorial for Canadians

Backwards skating looks impressive, opens up new skating possibilities, and is actually easier to learn than most beginners think! Whether you're on roller skates or inline skates in Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, or anywhere across Canada, this step-by-step tutorial will have you rolling backwards with confidence in just one practice session.

## Why Learn to Skate Backwards?

Before we dive into the how-to, here's why backwards skating is worth learning:

✅ **Safety**: Allows you to navigate away from obstacles without turning around
✅ **Versatility**: Essential skill for roller derby, hockey, and artistic skating
✅ **Control**: Improves your overall balance and edge control
✅ **Fun**: Opens up entirely new skating possibilities and tricks
✅ **Social**: Impress your friends and look like a pro at Canadian skating meetups
✅ **Fitness**: Engages different muscle groups for better workout variety

**Difficulty Level**: Intermediate (requires comfortable forward skating first)

**Time to Learn**: Most skaters get basic backwards movement in 15-30 minutes, feel confident within 2-3 practice sessions

**Prerequisites**:

- Can skate forward comfortably for 10+ minutes
- Can stop safely using heel brake or T-stop
- Feel stable on your skates in ready position

## The Key Difference: Roller Skates vs Inline Skates Backwards

Both roller skates and inline skates can skate backwards, but the technique differs slightly:

### Roller Skates (Quad Skates) Backwards

**Advantages**:
✅ Wider wheelbase makes balance easier
✅ Can pivot more independently on each foot
✅ Toe stops help with control and confidence
✅ Generally easier for absolute beginners to backward skating

**Best for**: Roller derby players, artistic skaters, rink skaters

### Inline Skates (Rollerblades) Backwards

**Advantages**:
✅ Longer wheelbase provides more speed when mastered
✅ More similar to ice skating backwards (familiar to hockey players)
✅ Better for trail skating once confident

**Challenges**:
⚠️ Narrower wheelbase requires better balance
⚠️ Takes slightly more practice initially

**Best for**: Fitness skaters, urban skaters, former ice hockey players

**Good News**: The fundamental technique is nearly identical. Once you learn one, switching to the other type of skate is easy!

## Safety First: Prepare to Learn Backwards

### Essential Safety Gear (No Exceptions!)

When learning backwards skating, you MUST wear:

✅ **Helmet** - Falls happen when learning, protect your head
✅ **Wrist guards** - Natural instinct is to catch yourself
✅ **Knee pads** - You might go down on knees  
✅ **Elbow pads** - Recommended for beginners

**Why it's extra important**: You're moving in an unnatural direction. Your reaction time to hazards is slower. One fall shouldn't end your skating journey.

### Choose the Right Practice Location

**Perfect for learning**:
✅ Empty parking lot (early morning) - Smooth, flat, predictable
✅ Indoor rink - Controlled environment, smooth surface
✅ Tennis/basketball court - Usually smooth, confined space
✅ Community center gym (with permission) - Safe, enclosed

**Avoid while learning**:
❌ Busy trails - Too many people, too much stress
❌ Rough pavement - Makes technique harder to feel
❌ Hills or slopes - Need flat surface for learning
❌ Areas near traffic - Safety risk when you're not looking forward

**Canadian Tip**: Community centers across Canada often have quiet times perfect for practice. Ask about "skill practice" times at your local facility.

## The 5-Minute Backwards Skating Tutorial

### Step 1: The Foundation - "Lemon" or "Bubbles" Exercise (2 minutes)

This is THE fundamental backwards skating technique. Master this, and you've got backwards skating.

**Starting Position**:

1. Stand with feet together, toes slightly touching
2. Knees bent (safety position)
3. Weight centered over both feet
4. Hands in front for balance
5. Look over your shoulder (choose one side)

**The Movement** (imagine drawing lemons or bubbles with your feet):

1. **Push toes apart** - Feet move outward in a "V" shape
2. **Reach maximum width** - About shoulder-width apart
3. **Bring heels together** - Use inner edges to pull heels inward
4. **Return to starting position** - Feet together again
5. **Repeat continuously** - This creates backward motion!

**What You Should Feel**:

- Pressure on inside edges of your skates
- Feet making continuous oval/lemon shapes
- Body moving backwards without stepping
- More glide as you get the rhythm

**Visual Cue**: Your feet draw a figure-8 or sideways lemon shape on the ground behind you.

**Common First-Attempt Issues**:

- "I'm not moving": Push toes apart more aggressively at start
- "I'm going sideways": Keep feet parallel and equal pressure on both sides
- "I feel unstable": Keep knees bent more, smaller movements
- "My feet keep getting too far apart": That's normal, reset and start again

**Practice Drill**: Do 10 "lemons" in a row. Rest. Repeat 5 times. You'll feel the rhythm developing.

### Step 2: Add Momentum - The First Backward Glide (1 minute)

Once you can do continuous lemons:

1. Do 3-4 lemons to build speed
2. Let yourself glide backwards with feet together
3. Feel the momentum you've created
4. When you slow down, start lemons again
5. Build confidence with the glide feeling

**Pro Tip**: The glide is where backwards skating becomes fun. At first, you might only glide 1-2 feet. That's perfect! Eventually, you'll glide 10-20 feet between lemon strokes.

**What Success Looks Like**:

- Lemon-lemon-lemon-GLIDE-lemon-lemon-lemon-GLIDE
- Smooth rhythm developing
- Moving backwards 10+ feet total
- Feeling stable and controlled

### Step 3: Steering and Control (1 minute)

Now you can move backwards! But can you control WHERE you go?

**To turn while going backwards**:

**Turn Left**:

- Put more pressure on your right foot
- Your body naturally curves left
- Keep doing lemons throughout turn

**Turn Right**:

- Put more pressure on your left foot
- Your body naturally curves right
- Maintain lemon movement

**Practice Pattern**:

- Backwards in a straight line for 20 feet
- Gentle curve to the left
- Straight for 20 feet
- Gentle curve to the right
- Repeat

**Looking Where You're Going**:

- Look over your shoulder (pick a side - most people prefer left)
- Rotate your upper body slightly
- Keep lower body neutral
- Switch looking sides periodically
- Eventually you'll feel obstacles without always looking

### Step 4: Stopping When Going Backwards (1 minute)

**Method 1: The Turnaround Stop** (Easiest)

1. Simply turn around to face forward
2. Use your normal forward stopping technique
3. Perfect for beginners

**Method 2: The V-Stop** (Intermediate)

1. From backwards glide
2. Push feet apart in wide "V"
3. Turn toes inward (pigeon-toed)
4. Press down to create friction
5. Similar to forward plow stop but reversed

**Method 3: T-Stop Backwards** (Advanced)

1. Extend one foot to the side
2. Drag it perpendicular to direction of travel
3. Gradually add pressure
4. Requires good one-foot balance

**Canadian Safety Note**: On outdoor trails in Canada, always know what's behind you before going backwards. Cyclists, other skaters, and pedestrians might not expect backwards movement.

## Practice Progression: Your First 4 Practice Sessions

### Session 1 (20-30 minutes): The Basics

- ✅ Master the lemon technique standing still
- ✅ First 5-10 feet of backwards movement
- ✅ Build muscle memory for the motion
- ✅ Get comfortable with the feeling

**Success Metric**: Can do 10 consecutive lemons and move backwards 10 feet

### Session 2 (30 minutes): Building Confidence

- ✅ Increase backward distance to 30-50 feet
- ✅ Add momentum with glide phases
- ✅ Practice gentle left and right curves
- ✅ Work on looking over shoulder

**Success Metric**: Can skate backwards 50 feet with control, including gentle turns

### Session 3 (30-45 minutes): Real-World Practice

- ✅ Combine forward and backward skating
- ✅ Practice transitions (forward to backward)
- ✅ Increase speed slightly
- ✅ Try backward skating on different surfaces

**Success Metric**: Comfortable backwards for 2-3 minutes continuously, can transition smoothly

### Session 4 (45+ minutes): Refinement

- ✅ Smooth, efficient backwards technique
- ✅ Confident turns and direction changes
- ✅ Comfortable speed variations
- ✅ Ready for trails and real skating situations

**Success Metric**: Backwards skating feels natural, can use it practically while skating

## Common Mistakes (And How to Fix Them)

### Mistake #1: Looking Down at Feet

**Why it's wrong**: Throws off balance, can't see where you're going, prevents learning proper feeling

**How to fix**:

- Force yourself to look over your shoulder
- Trust your feet - they know where the ground is
- Practice the motion on carpet first if needed
- Have someone guide you verbally for first few tries

### Mistake #2: Stiff Legs

**Why it's wrong**: No shock absorption, can't feel the edges, looks awkward

**How to fix**:

- Constant reminder: "Bend your knees"
- Your thighs should feel a slight burn
- Think of sitting in a chair while skating
- Deep knee bend = better control and faster learning

### Mistake #3: Feet Too Far Apart

**Why it's wrong**: Lose control, risk doing splits, technique breaks down

**How to fix**:

- Start with smaller lemons
- Focus on bringing heels back together quickly
- Think "squeeze" on the inward phase
- Shoulder-width is maximum separation

### Mistake #4: Going Too Fast Too Soon

**Why it's wrong**: Loss of control, increases fear, can't learn proper technique

**How to fix**:

- Slow down the lemon movements
- Focus on precision over speed
- Speed comes naturally once technique is solid
- Take breaks to reset and refocus

### Mistake #5: Not Using Edges

**Why it's wrong**: Can't generate backward momentum, just shuffling feet

**How to fix**:

- Focus on inside edges of both skates
- Feel pressure on big toe side of foot
- Press down through the edges during lemons
- Quality wheels and proper skate setup help (check below)

### Mistake #6: Giving Up After 5 Minutes

**Why it's wrong**: Backwards skating takes practice - it feels weird at first!

**How to fix**:

- Expect awkwardness initially - totally normal
- Most people need 2-3 sessions to feel comfortable
- Take breaks but keep trying
- Remember how weird forward skating felt at first?

## Advanced Backwards Techniques (Once You Master the Basics)

### Backwards Crossovers

**What they are**: Crossing one foot over the other while skating backwards, allows sharp turns

**When to learn**: After 4-6 weeks of comfortable backwards skating

**Applications**: Roller derby, artistic skating, navigating tight spaces

### Backwards One-Foot Gliding

**What it is**: Gliding backwards on a single skate

**When to learn**: After mastering two-foot backwards gliding

**Applications**: Artistic moves, transitions, showing off

### Mohawk Turn (Forward to Backward Transition)

**What it is**: Smooth turn from forward to backward skating without stopping

**When to learn**: Intermediate skill, after confident backwards skating

**Applications**: Roller derby, dance skating, advanced trail skating

### Backward Skating Speed Development

**Focus areas**:

- Powerful edge pressure
- Longer glide phases
- Efficient energy transfer
- Core engagement

**When to develop**: After 3+ months of regular backwards practice

## Equipment Considerations for Backwards Skating

### Skates

**Your current skates are probably fine**, but if you plan to do a lot of backwards skating:

**Roller Skates**:

- Consider hybrid wheels (multi-surface)
- Proper toe stop alignment matters more
- Adjustable trucks allow better control

**Inline Skates**:

- Rockered setup (slightly shorter middle wheels) helps with agility
- 4-wheel setups generally better than 3-wheel for backwards
- Frames designed for artistic skating perform better

### Wheels

**Characteristics that help backwards skating**:
✅ **Hardness**: 78A-85A (softer = more grip)
✅ **Size**: Smaller wheels = easier control (72-80mm inline, 57-62mm roller)
✅ **Profile**: Rounded profile allows easier edge work

**Upgrade Priority**:

- Beginners: Stock wheels are fine
- After 6 months: Consider wheel upgrade if skating backwards frequently

### Bearings

**For backwards skating**:

- ABEC 5 or 7 = Ideal for learning control
- ABEC 9 = Only if you're advancing to speed backwards skating
- Sealed bearings = Essential for Canadian outdoor conditions

### Frame Setup (Inline Skates Only)

**Standard**: 4 wheels in line, equal size

- Works for backwards skating
- Most versatile

**Rockered**: Middle wheels slightly smaller or axles adjusted

- Better turning and backwards agility
- Trade-off: slightly less stable for distance
- Popular for artistic and urban skating

## Backwards Skating in Different Canadian Contexts

### Indoor Rinks (Ontario, BC, Alberta Community Centers)

**Advantages**:

- Smooth, predictable surface
- Year-round availability
- Safe learning environment
- Often have coaching available

- Requires awareness of other trail users

**Safety Protocol**:

- Only backwards skate when trail is clear
- Frequently check behind you
- Stay to right side of path
- Signal before doing backwards movements

**Best Trails for Practicing**:

- Wide, smooth sections with good visibility
- Early morning when less crowded
- Straight sections first, curves later

### Roller Derby Context

**Backwards skating in derby**:

- Essential skill for all positions
- Usually learned after 3-6 months of derby
- Requires confidence in high-traffic situations

**Canadian Roller Derby Leagues**:

- Most major Canadian cities have leagues
- "Fresh Meat" programs teach backwards skating systematically
- Community is supportive and instructional

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: "I'm just not moving backwards at all"

**Possible causes & solutions**:

1. **Not using edges**: Focus on pressing inside edges during lemons
2. **Feet too close together**: Start with wider lemons
3. **Knees not bent**: Lower your center of gravity
4. **Wheels too hard**: Consider softer wheels (78A-82A)
5. **Bearings dirty/sticky**: Clean and lubricate bearings

### Problem: "I keep going in circles"

**Possible causes & solutions**:

1. **Uneven pressure**: Consciously equalize pressure on both feet
2. **Looking too far over one shoulder**: Balance head position
3. **Stronger leg dominance**: Practice isolating weaker side
4. **Asymmetric technique**: Video yourself to identify differences

### Problem: "I feel terrified going backwards"

**Possible causes & solutions**:

1. **Moving too fast**: Slow down dramatically, tiny movements
2. **Wrong location**: Find safer, more enclosed practice spot
3. **Not enough safety gear**: Add extra padding for confidence
4. **Need gradual exposure**: Practice backward stepping first, then rolling
5. **Completely normal**: Most people feel this way - it's a natural fear

### Problem: "My wheels don't seem to grip for backwards"

**Possible causes & solutions**:

1. **Too-hard wheels**: Switch to softer durometer (78A-82A)
2. **Worn wheels**: Check for flat spots, might need replacement
3. **Wrong edges**: Really focus on inside edge pressure
4. **Surface too slippery**: Try different practice location
5. **Old/dirty wheels**: Clean or replace if very worn

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does it take to learn to skate backwards?**

A: Most skaters get basic backwards movement in their first 20-30 minute practice session. Feeling truly comfortable and confident usually takes 3-5 practice sessions over 2-3 weeks. By 3 months of regular practice, backwards skating should feel natural.

**Q: Is backwards skating harder on inline skates or roller skates?**

A: Slightly easier on roller skates initially due to wider wheelbase, but the difference isn't huge. If you're already comfortable on inline skates forward, learning backwards on inline skates is very achievable. Choose based on what you already own and prefer.

**Q: Can I learn backwards skating as a beginner, or do I need to be advanced?**

A: You need to be comfortable skating forward first - not necessarily "advanced," but able to skate confidently for 10+ minutes, stop safely, and feel stable. If you can do that, you're ready to learn backwards. Absolute beginners should master forward skating first (usually 1-2 months).

**Q: Why do I keep going in circles when I try to skate backwards?**

A: Usually because you're putting uneven pressure on your feet, or looking too far over one shoulder. Focus on keeping equal pressure on both skates, and balance your upper body. Video yourself if possible - it's often obvious when you watch yourself.

**Q: What wheels are best for learning backwards skating in Canada?**

A: Softer wheels (78A-82A durometer) provide better grip for learning. Indoor: 78A-80A. Outdoor on Canadian pavement: 80A-84A. Larger wheels (80mm+ for inline, 62mm+ for roller) once you're comfortable, but smaller wheels okay for learning.

**Q: Is backwards skating dangerous?**

A: Not with proper safety gear and sensible progression. The main risk is colliding with obstacles you don't see. Always practice in safe, clear areas. Wear full protective gear. Look over your shoulder frequently. Follow our learning progression and backwards skating is quite safe.

**Q: Can I practice backwards skating in Canadian winter?**

A: Indoors, yes! Community centers and roller rinks across Canada operate year-round. Outdoors below 5°C is not recommended - falls on cold pavement are more dangerous, and equipment performs poorly in extreme cold.

**Q: My ankles hurt when skating backwards. Is this normal?**

A: Some ankle fatigue when learning is normal (you're using muscles differently). However, pain suggests your boots might lack support or you're not bending knees enough. Make sure you have proper skating boots (not cheap recreational skates). If pain continues, consider ankle strengthening exercises or consulting a skating coach.

**Q: How do I stop being scared of backwards skating?**

A: Start slower and smaller than you think necessary. Practice on soft surfaces first (grass, carpet) just doing the motion. Build up gradually. Wear ALL your safety gear. Accept that backwards feels weird initially for everyone. Fear decreases dramatically after 2-3 successful practice sessions.

## Conclusion: Your Backwards Skating Journey

Backwards skating transforms you from a casual skater into someone with real skills. Whether you're preparing for roller derby, want to impress friends on Toronto's trails, or simply enjoy learning new techniques, backwards skating is an incredibly rewarding skill.

**Remember**:
✅ Master the lemon technique - it's 90% of backwards skating
✅ Practice in safe, clear areas
✅ Wear full safety gear every time
✅ Be patient - it feels weird at first for everyone
✅ 2-3 practice sessions = comfortable basics
