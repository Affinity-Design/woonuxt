# Pro Skates: What the Professionals Use

When you watch competitive skaters glide effortlessly across the pavement or execute complex tricks, it's easy to wonder: _what are they wearing on their feet?_ **Pro skates** are a significant step up from recreational models, designed for performance, precision, and durability. In this guide, we'll dive deep into the world of professional skating gear.

## What Defines "Pro Skates"?

Professional skates aren't just expensive versions of beginner skates. They are engineered differently.

### 1. Materials

Pro skates often use carbon fiber shells instead of plastic. This provides:

- **Stiffness:** Better energy transfer from your leg to the wheels.
- **Weight:** Significantly lighter, allowing for faster movement.
- **Heat Molding:** Custom fit capabilities that conform exactly to your foot.

### 2. Frames and Wheels

The frame is the chassis of the skate. Pro frames are typically made from extruded aluminum or carbon fiber. They are rigid and precise. Wheels on pro skates feature higher quality urethane with specific rebounds suited for different surfaces (indoor vs. outdoor).

## Types of Pro Skates

Different disciplines require different tools.

### Speed Skating

Speed skates are the Formula 1 cars of the skating world. They feature:

- Low-cut boots for maximum ankle mobility.
- Long frames for stability at high speeds.
- Large wheels (100mm, 110mm, or 125mm).

Comparing these to recreational models, you'll notice the lack of cuff support, which demands strong ankle muscles.

### Aggressive Skating

Professional aggressive skaters need boots that can withstand impact. Their skates feature:

- Heavy-duty soul plates for grinding.
- Smaller wheels for lower center of gravity.
- Anti-rocker setups (two small middle wheels) to make grinding easier.

## Choosing Your First Pair of Pro Skates

If you're looking to upgrade from your beginner setup, consider what you need. Are you looking for speed, or are you looking to do tricks?

> **Tip:** Don't jump straight to a low-cut speed boot if you haven't built up your ankle strength. A high-end marathon skate might be a better transition.

## Maintenance for Pro Gear

Owning pro skates means taking pro-level care of them.

1.  **Rotate your wheels** regularly to ensure even wear.
2.  **Clean your bearings.** Pro bearings are often serviceable.
3.  **Check your bolts.** Vibration can loosen frame bolts over time.

## Conclusion

Investing in **pro skates** is an investment in your performance. Whether you are racing marathons or hitting the skate park, the right equipment makes a difference.
