# Cloudflare Pages Redirects Configuration
# CRITICAL: Static assets must NOT be caught by SPA fallback

# Blog post redirects (without /blog prefix redirect to /blog/slug)
# These are dynamically generated from blog posts

# SPA fallback for client-side routing
# This catches all requests that don't match static files
# Cloudflare Pages automatically serves files from _nuxt/ directory
# so we DON'T need explicit rules for /_nuxt/*
